Bear in mind that the casino offers both traditional blackjack and its own variation, called "Bonus Blackjack". In Bonus Blackjack, players are dealt two cards and the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down. If the player's first two cards are an Ace and a 10-point card (a "blackjack"), they win automatically, regardless of what the dealer has.

Players at Point Casino can also take advantage of some great blackjack betting options. For example, they can bet on whether the next card will be red or black, or even whether the next card will be higher or lower than the previous one. This makes for some exciting gameplay, especially when there's money on the line.

So if you're looking to enjoy some more action-packed blackjack at Point Casino before it closes for the night, don't delay! Get in your last games now and see if you can walk away a winner.
