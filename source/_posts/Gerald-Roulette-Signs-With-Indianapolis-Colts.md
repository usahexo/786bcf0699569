#  Gerald Roulette Signs With Indianapolis Colts

The Gerald Roulette signing is complete, as the defensive lineman has agreed to a one-year deal with the Indianapolis Colts.

Roulette, who turns 26 this offseason, recorded six sacks last season for the Arizona Cardinals. He was an undrafted free agent out of Texas A&M in 2016, and has appeared in 29 games over two seasons.

The Colts are looking to add depth to their defensive line, and Roulette should compete for a backup role in camp.

#  Gerald Roulette Could Be Key Piece For Indianapolis Colts' Defense

In any sport, there are always players who seemingly come out of nowhere to make a big impact. Maybe they were overlooked in college or maybe they were simply under the radar before joining the professional ranks. In the NFL, one player who fits that description is Gerald Roulette.

Roulette was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Indianapolis Colts in May of 2018. After a strong preseason, he earned a spot on the Colts' 53-man roster. And in Week 1 of the regular season, Roulette made his presence felt by recording two sacks against the Cincinnati Bengals.

It's still early, but it looks like the Colts may have found themselves a diamond in the rough with Gerald Roulette. He has already shown that he can be a disruptive force on defense, and if he continues to play at a high level, he could be key piece for the Colts' defense in 2019 and beyond.

#  Gerald Roulette: Starting Point For the Indianapolis Colts' Defense?

In the NFL, it is essential to have a competent defense. This is especially true for teams that do not have an elite offense. The Indianapolis Colts had a porous defense in 2017. They were ranked 31st in the league in defensive DVOA. There were many reasons for this. One of the main reasons was their lack of a quality starting cornerback.

The Colts decided to remedy this by signing cornerback Patrick Robinson in free agency. Robinson has been a solid player throughout his career. He is coming off of a season in which he had three interceptions and eight passes defended. The addition of Robinson should help to improve the Colts' secondary significantly.

However, the most important player on the Colts' defense is defensive end/outside linebacker Jabaal Sheard. Sheard had a down year in 2017, but he is still a very talented player. He recorded 7.5 sacks in 2016 and he has the potential to reach double-digits sacks this season. If Sheard can return to form, then the Colts' defense will be much better off.

The key for the Indianapolis Colts' defense this season is going to be consistency. They cannot afford to have games where they are completely dominated by opposing offenses like they did last year. If they can play at a level close to their potential, then they should be able to compete with most teams in the NFL.

#  Gerald Roulette Poised To Help Indianapolis Colts' Defense In 2015

The Indianapolis Colts have one of the best offenses in the NFL. Led by Andrew Luck, they are always a threat to put up points. However, their defense has been less than stellar in recent years. In an effort to improve that side of the ball, the Colts signed defensive end Gerald Roulette to a free agent contract this offseason.

Roulette should help improve the Colts' pass rush. He had 7 sacks for the Houston Texans last year, and he is known for his ability to get after the quarterback. With Robert Mathis out for the first four games of the season due to suspension, Roulette will be counted on to provide pressure on opposing quarterbacks right from the start.

The Colts' defense was ranked 27th in the league last year in terms of yardage allowed. They clearly need to improve if they want to make a playoff run this year. Adding Gerald Roulette to their lineup is a step in the right direction. He is a solid player who will make an impact on this team.

#  Gerald Roulette May Play A Bigger Role With Indianapolis Colts In 2015

Gerald Roulette was undrafted out of the University of Houston in 2014 but he caught the attention of Indianapolis Colts coaches with his play in offseason workouts. Roulette’s strong play continued into training camp and preseason where he forced a fumble and recorded an interception. Heading into the regular season, Roulette was waived and signed to the Colts’ practice squad. Roulette was promoted to the active roster in Week 10 and played in six games, primarily on special teams.

With starting defensive tackle Arthur Jones now a member of the Baltimore Ravens, Roulette could see more playing time in 2015. In an interview with Colts.com, Roulette said he’s been studying film of Jones to try and replicate his style.

“I learned he’s got a lot of power, very explosive off the ball and uses his hands well. I’ve just been trying to mimic that as much as possible so hopefully I can have some success like he did,” Roulette said.

Roulette has also put on weight since last year, bulking up to 300 pounds. The extra weight will help him hold up against offensive linemen at the point of attack.

It will be interesting to see how much playing time Roulette gets this year, but it appears he has a good chance to make an impact on defense for the Colts.
