#  I stopped gambling 100 days ago and now I'm debt-free!

I’m not a gambling addict and I’ve never had a problem with it, but for some reason, every once in a while, I get the urge to go to the casino. And before I know it, I’m wasting money that I don’t have on games of chance.

This happened to me a few months ago and I decided that enough was enough. I was sick of feeling like a financial slave to the casino and so I made the decision to stop gambling altogether.

At first, this was really tough. The temptation to gamble was really strong and it seemed like every other person my age was talking about their weekend trip to the casino. But I stuck with it and, after 100 days, I can say that my decision has paid off.

Not only am I debt-free, but I’ve also been able to save quite a bit of money. This is because, when you don’t gamble, you don’t have any reason to spend money on unnecessary things.

So if you find yourself struggling with a gambling addiction, or if you just want to save some money, then follow my lead and stop gambling altogether. It might be tough at first, but it will be well worth it in the end!

I quit gambling 100 days ago and my life has never been better!

The first thing I did was to get rid of any material possessions that triggering gambling thoughts. This included all my casino paraphernalia, as well as any magazines or books related to gambling.

I also deleted any online accounts that I had with gambling websites.

It was a little hard at first, but I soon found new activities to occupy my time. I started hiking and biking, which I really enjoy. I’ve also been spending more time with family and friends, which has been really nice.

I don’t miss gambling at all. In fact, the thought of it now makes me feel sick to my stomach. I know that if I ever relapse, it will only lead to more heartache and pain. So for now, I am content to stay away from it entirely.

Quitting gambling was one of the best decisions I have ever made! My life is so much better without it!

I'm not a gambler. I never have been, and I never will be. The mere idea of risking money in the hopes of winning more money in return is not something that appeals to me in the slightest. So why, then, did I find myself regularly gambling online?

It all started as a bit of harmless fun. A few spins on a slot machine here, a few rounds of blackjack there; nothing too serious. But before long, I had become completely hooked. I was spending hours upon hours gambling, losing more and more money each time.

In the end, I had no choice but to face up to the fact that I had developed a gambling addiction. I was losing control and ruining my life in the process. So I made the decision to stop gambling 100 days ago, and I'm so glad I did!

Since giving up gambling, my life has improved drastically. My mental health has improved, my financial situation has stabilized, and I am now enjoying life far more than ever before. If you are struggling with a gambling addiction, then I urge you to do the same and take back control of your life!

#  My life has completely changed since I stopped gambling 100 days ago!

I never imagined that I would become a pathological gambler. It all started innocently enough. I would gamble a little bit when I was feeling bored or when I wanted to try my luck. But, before I knew it, I was gambling every day and spending hours on end at the casino or online gambling sites.

Gambling had become an addiction and was wreaking havoc on my life. I was losing sleep, becoming irritable, and was even starting to neglect my work and family responsibilities. Worst of all, I was completely bankrupt and had no hope of ever recovering.

That's when I decided to seek help. I found a support group for pathological gamblers and committed to quitting gambling 100 days ago. It's been tough at times, but it's definitely worth it!

Here are some of the biggest changes that have happened in my life since quitting gambling: 

1) My mental health has improved markedly. Gambling is an incredibly stressful activity, and it was taking its toll on my mental health. Since quitting, I've been able to relax and focus on other things that make me happy. 
2) My relationships with family and friends have grown stronger. They were very supportive during my gambling addiction, and they're glad to see me doing better now. 
3) My financial situation has also improved dramatically. Because I wasn't able to stop borrowing money to gamble, I had amassed a lot of debt. But now that I've stopped gambling, I'm able to slowly pay off my debts. 
4) Lastly, I'm much more productive now that I don't have gambling distractions occupying my time. Instead of spending hours at the casino or online casinos, I'm now focusing on work, hobbies, and spending time with family and friends

#  I stopped gambling 100 days ago and it was the best decision I ever made!

I never imagined that I would be able to stop gambling cold turkey, but that is exactly what I did 100 days ago and it was the best decision I ever made!

It all started about 2 years ago when I started gambling on slot machines. At first it was just for a bit of fun, but before long I was addicted and couldn't stop. I would gamble away all my money and then borrow money from friends and family in order to keep playing. My life was spiraling out of control and I didn't know how to stop.

But then something happened that changed everything. I lost all my money in one night and was left with nothing. This was the wake-up call that I needed and it was the catalyst for me to finally get help.

I sought out help from a professional gambler who helped me to understand why I had become addicted to gambling in the first place. He also taught me how to deal with my addiction and how to stay away from casinos and slot machines.

The best part of this whole experience has been 100 days without gambling! It has been tough at times, but it has been worth it! Not only have I saved a lot of money, but I have also regained control over my life.
