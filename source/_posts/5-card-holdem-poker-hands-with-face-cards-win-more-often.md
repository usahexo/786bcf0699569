## Introduction

In this article, we'll use JungleRaja to find the best five-card poker hands with face cards. We'll first look at the hands with three face cards, and then look at the hands with four face cards.

#  What are the odds of getting a 5-card holdem poker hand with 2 face cards?

Anyone who has ever played poker, or even watched others play, has probably wondered what the odds are of getting a particular hand. The answer to this question depends on the game being played and the number of players involved. For example, the odds of receiving a three of a kind in five-card draw poker are far different than the odds of being dealt two face cards in Texas hold'em.

The following table lists some common poker hands and their odds when playing against a single opponent:

Poker Hand Odds Royal Flush 1 in 649,739 Straight Flush 1 in 72,193 Four of a Kind 1 in 4,164 Full House 1 in 694 Flush 1 in 508 Straight 1 in 254 Three of a Kind 1 in 47 Two Pair 1 in 21 One Pair 1 in 2.9 No pair (high card) 1 in 2

As can be seen from the table, the odds of receiving certain hands increase as the number of players decreases. This is because with more players at the table, the chances that someone will already have one of the desired hands increase. For example, if there are ten players at a texas hold'em table and one person is dealt two face cards, then that player has about a 11% chance of winning the hand. However, if there are only two players at the table, then the player with two face cards would be almost certain to win

If you are looking to find the best 5-card poker hand with 2 face cards, look no further than JungleRaja. We have all the information you need to make the right decision every time.

In holdem poker, the Ace can be used as either a high or low card, so the best possible hand is A2345. However, if one of the other players has an Ace too, then your hand is not as good.

When it comes to choosing a hand with 2 face cards, there are a few different options that you can go for. A Pair (two cards of the same rank) is always a good option, as is two Suited Cards (cards of the same suit). If you have three different suits then you could have Trips (three of a kind), and if you have four different suits then you could have a Full House (a pair and three of a kind).

Of course, if none of these options are available then you will need to choose another 5-card poker hand. The highest ranked card in your hand is always important, so make sure that you keep track of which ones are worth the most points. In general, it is always a good idea to try and make as many pairs and trips as possible – these will give you the best chance of winning the hand.
