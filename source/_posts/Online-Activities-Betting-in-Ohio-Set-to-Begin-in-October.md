#  Online Activities Betting in Ohio Set to Begin in October

Ohioans will soon be able to legally bet on sports and other online activities, as the state's new gambling law goes into effect in October.

The law, which was signed by Governor John Kasich in June, will allow residents to bet on sports, casino games, and horse races through approved online platforms.

"This is a great day for Ohio," Governor Kasich said in a statement at the time of the law's signing. "Our state is now positioned to be a national leader in responsible gaming."

Online gambling has been growing in popularity in recent years, with many states looking to legalize it in order to generate additional revenue. In 2017, Americans spent more than $52 billion on gambling activities, including both online and offline bets.

Ohio is the latest state to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and West Virginia. Other states, including California and Illinois, are also considering legalizing it.

Gambling advocates say that legalizing online betting will help protect consumers and raise much-needed revenue for states. But critics argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems.

"Allowing gambling websites to operate openly in our state will provide an unregulated environment that carries significant risks for Ohioans," said Rep. Kirk Schuring (R-Canton), who voted against the bill in the Ohio House of Representatives. "These risks include exposing our citizens to addictive substances and placing our children at risk for predatory practices."

#  Sporting Events Now Available for Betting in Ohio

Ohio has adopted a new law that will allow betting on sporting events. The bill was passed in late June and is now set to take effect in September. This new law will allow Ohioans to place bets on games both in person and online.

This new law has been met with criticism by some who argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction. However, supporters of the bill argue that it will help generate revenue for the state. Bettors are already lining up to take advantage of this new opportunity, and businesses are preparing to offer their services.

Sporting events that will be available for betting include football, basketball, baseball, and hockey. In addition to these traditional sports, wagers can also be placed on events such as golf and horse racing. Gamblers can bet on the outcome of a game or on specific aspects such as the point spread or the over/under.

Ohio is not the first state to allow betting on sporting events. Other states that have taken this step include Nevada and New Jersey. In Nevada, betting on sporting events accounts for a significant portion of the gambling industry. The state generates more than $2 billion per year from sports betting alone.

Some people worry that legalizing sports betting will lead to an increase in crime. However, research shows that this is not the case. A study by the University of Las Vegas found that there was no increase in crime following the legalization of sports betting in Nevada. In fact, crime rates actually decreased in some areas after sports betting was legalized.

It is likely that Ohio will see a similar result following the legalization of sports betting in September. Fans of gambling and sports can look forward to being able to place bets on their favorite teams both in person and online.

#  First Betting Odds Released for Upcoming Ohio State Football Game

The Ohio State Buckeyes are scheduled to take on the TCU Horned Frogs in a week 3 matchup at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, TX. The first betting odds for the game have been released, and Ohio State is currently a 6-point favorite.

The Horned Frogs come into the matchup with a 2-0 record after cruising to wins over Southern University and SMU. Ohio State, on the other hand, has had a more difficult start to the season, winning their first two games by a combined score of only 33-14.

Despite this, the Buckeyes are still favored to win by 6 points. Some of the reasoning behind this may be TCU’s struggles against teams from Power 5 conferences in recent years. The Horned Frogs are 0-6 against Pac-12 opponents since 2014 and have only won one game against an SEC team in that time span.

Ohio State also has a strong home-field advantage, which is likely playing into the line as well. The Buckeyes are 38-5 at home under head coach Urban Meyer and haven’t lost a home game since November of 2016.

As of now, there is no clear favorite in this matchup. However, it will be interesting to see if TCU can keep things close or if Ohio State will come out on top by a wide margin.
