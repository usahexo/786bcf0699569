#  Neymar Jr. and Mbappé Lead Paris Saint-Germain to Third Straight Ligue 1 Title

Neymar Jr. and Kylian Mbappé have each scored 19 goals as Paris Saint-Germain have won the French Ligue 1 for the third consecutive season. The Parisians clinched their latest title with a 7-1 victory over last year’s runners-up Monaco on Sunday.

Neymar Jr., who transferred from Barcelona in the summer of 2017 for a world-record fee of 222 million euros, has been crucial to PSG’s success in Ligue 1. The Brazilian superstar has registered 52 goals and 28 assists in just 60 appearances for the club in all competitions.

Kylian Mbappé, who was also brought to the Parc des Princes last year by current PSG manager Thomas Tuchel, has been equally impressive. The 20-year-old Frenchman has not only scored 19 goals in Ligue 1 this season but also netted 14 times in 15 Champions League appearances as PSG reached the quarterfinals of Europe’s top club competition.

With Neymar Jr. and Mbappé both in such impressive form, it is no wonder that PSG have cruised to another league championship. The two forwards have formed a deadly partnership that has terrorized defenses throughout France and Europe.

While Neymar Jr. and Mbappé have been the stars of PSG’s season, it should not be forgotten that they are part of a very talented team. Daniel Alves, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, Marco Verratti, and Ángel Di María are all top players who have helped make PSG one of the best teams in the world.

Tuchel will now hope to lead PSG to even greater success next season by winning the Champions League. The German manager will know that he can count on Neymar Jr. and Mbappé to deliver the goods when it matters most.

In what was a stunning and dominant performance by Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), Neymar Jr. and Kylian Mbappé both led the way in scoring as they downed Liverpool 3-1 in the UEFA Champions League (UCL)’s sixth matchday.

Playing at Anfield, Liverpool started off the stronger of the two sides but PSG soon began to take control. Neymar Jr. opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a superb free kick, his sixth goal in this year’s UCL. Mbappé then doubled PSG’s lead just after halftime, before Roberto Firmino pulled one back for Liverpool in the 76th minute. However, it was not enough as Neymar Jr. 
led PSG to a 3-1 victory, ensuring their place in the quarterfinals of this year’s UCL.

Neymar Jr., who transferred from Barcelona to PSG last summer for a world-record €222 million fee, has now scored 45 goals in 50 games for his new club. Mbappé, who is just 19 years old, has been even more impressive, scoring 20 goals in just 23 games since joining PSG on loan from Monaco in the summer. With these two leading the way, PSG are now one of the favorites to win this year’s UCL title.
