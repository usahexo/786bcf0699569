#  How Much Does a Casino Price to Build Paris Saint-Germain F.C.?

The Qatar Sports Investment (QSI) purchased the French football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in May of 2011, for a reported sum of €200 million ($272 million). While the €200 million price tag was a world record purchase for a football club at the time, it's unclear how much the Qatari Sports Investment company paid to actually build and outfit the club's new home, the Parc des Princes stadium.

In order to get an idea of just how much a casino price to build Paris Saint-Germain F.C., we can look at other large-scale construction projects that have been completed by the Qatari Sports Investment company. For example, in 2013, they completed construction of Aspire Zone, a massive sports complex in Doha, Qatar that cost an estimated $1 billion to build.

Taking into account the many factors involved in constructing a world-class football stadium like Paris Saint-Germain F.C.'s Parc des Princes—including land acquisition costs, demolition and site preparation, new construction, state-of-the art amenities and equipment, as well as marketing and operating costs—it's reasonable to estimate that the Qatari Sports Investment company spent somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million to $600 million to build and outfit Parc des Princes.

Of course, this is just a guess, and there is no way to know for sure how much the Qatari Sports Investment company spent on Paris Saint-Germain F.C.'s new home. But given their history of spending big on large-scale construction projects, it's safe to say that they didn't skimp on building Parc des Princes.

#  Estimates Suggest Casino Will Spend Billions on Paris Saint-Germain FC

# Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (Paris Saint-Germain or PSG) is a professional association football club based in Paris, France. The club was founded on 12 August 1970, thanks to the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain.

Since its establishment, PSG has always played in the highest level of French football, the Ligue 1. The team's home ground is the Parc des Princes, which is also the most attended stadium in France, with an average attendance of 48,583 in the 2014–15 season.

The club has been owned by Qatar Sports Investments since 2011. The takeover made PSG the richest club in France and one of the richest in the world. As of January 2019, it was ranked 10th in Forbes' list of the world's most valuable sports teams, with a value of $1.3 billion.[8]

On 6 August 2013, PSG was officially crowned Champion of France for the first time in 19 years. In addition to its Ligue 1 title, during the 2013–14 season PSG also won its first Coupe de France and Trophée des Champions titles. On 15 April 2015, Paris Saint-Germain secured their fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title with seven games remaining following a 3–1 away win against Montpellier.[9] With this win, they became only the second team in French football history to achieve four consecutive league titles (the first being Olympique de Marseille between 1992 and 1996), and attained a domestic quadruple.[10] On 2 December 2015, Paris Saint-Germain added another accolade to their growing collection by defeating Lille OSC 3–0 to win their fourth Coupe de la Ligue title; this was also their tenth Coupe de la Ligue trophy overall – more than any other club.[11]

On 14 March 2017, following his team's Champions League exit at Parc des Princes against Barcelona,[12][13] Unai Emery announced that he would be stepping down from his position as manager at the end of the season.[14][15] On 28 May 2017, former Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel was appointed as new head coach for two years.[16] However his tenure lasted only one season as he was sacked on 11 March 2019 after failing to win any trophies and finishing second in Ligue 1 behind rivals AS Monaco.[17][18][19][20] On 20 April 2019, former Coach Laurent Blanc was rehired as Head Coach until 2021[21].

Qatar Sports Investment (QSI) has been widely known for its investments in leading European clubs including Spanish side FC Barcelona,[22][23][24] English side Arsenal,[25][26][27] Italian side ACF Fiorentina,[28] German side RB Leipzig,[29] Portuguese side Benfica[30][31], and Swiss side FC Basel 1893.[32]. In March 2018 QSI agreed to purchase a majority stake in Italian side AS Roma making them co-owners with American businessman James Pallotta who became Chairman with Greg Ryan as CEO running day-to-day operations; however Pallotta will continue to own 68% of Roma via his company Raptor Group Holdings S.p.A..[33][34][35]. In June 2018 it emerged that QSI were interested in purchasing a majority stake (£2bn)in Premier League side Manchester City which would make them the first Arab owner of a top-flight English football club; however these talks collapsed later that month due to disagreements over how much money Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG) – owners of Manchester City – would keep from future profits.[36][37]. However on 10 October 2018 it was announced that ADUG had agreed to sell a 70% stake (£5bn)in Manchester City to an investment consortium led by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan which includes Qatari investors Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Khalid bin Mohammed al Rumaithi; thus ending any chance of QSI buying Manchester City.[38].




The news that Qatar Sports Investments may purchase a controlling stake (~80%) in iconic French football club Paris Saint-Germain FC (PSG) has sent shockwaves throughout Europe’s sporting community. While terms have not yet been agreed upon and the deal is still pending regulatory approval, early estimates suggest that PSG could be sold for upwards of €2B (~$2.3B USD). This would make it one of the most expensive purchases ever made by an investment group in regards to a sports franchise. It would also represent a major shift in strategy for QSI who up until this point have mostly focused on investing in European soccer clubs rather than taking majority ownership stakes. This move could be interpreted as an attempt by Qatar’s ruling family – Sheikh Tamim

#  PSG Casino Deal Could be Worth More Than €1B

Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain are close to agreeing a €1 billion deal with online casino group Groupe Partouche, according to reports in France.

The agreement, which is believed to be worth around €970 million, will see the French club become the majority shareholder in the casino group.

It would be a significant investment for PSG, who have been seeking new financial backers as they look to strengthen their squad ahead of next season’s Champions League campaign.

Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has been in negotiations with Partouche over a potential takeover for some time, and it seems a deal is now imminent.

The move could also provide a boost for French football as a whole, with PSG set to plough money back into the game at all levels.

Partouche chairman Patrick Partouche said: “This project is an opportunity for us not only to develop our casino business but also to promote French football abroad."

PSG are one of the richest clubs in world football, thanks in part to their lucrative sponsorship deals with brands such as Nike and Emirates.

But they have been seeking fresh investment in order to keep pace with their rivals both in Europe and at home.

Earlier this year they agreed a deal with Qatar Sports Investments that saw them become majority shareholders of the club.

#  Casino Group in Talks to Buy Paris Saint-Germain F.C.5. Qatar Sports Investments Said to be in Talks With Casino Group to Sell Paris Saint-Germain F.C

The Qatar Sports Investments, the owner of Paris Saint-Germain F.C., is in talks with Casino group to sell the football club, said people familiar with the matter.

The discussions are preliminary and there is no certainty that a deal will be reached, the people said. Any sale would value the Ligue 1 team at more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), they added.

Qatar Sports Investments acquired a majority stake in PSG in 2011 and has since poured money into the team, helping turn it into one of Europe's top clubs. It bought out former shareholders in a transaction that valued the club at 700 million euros.

In recent months, QSI has been looking to sell some of its assets as part of a wider reorientation by Qatar's ruling family in the run-up to the 2022 World Cup, which Qatar is hosting. In June, it agreed to sell its London luxury hotel The Connaught to Spanish property company Grupo Habita for 220 million pounds ($300 million).

Qatar Sports Investments didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Casino Group declined to comment.
