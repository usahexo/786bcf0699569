#  If gambling was added to DSM-5, blackjack would be the most popular game!

 DSM-5 is the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This manual is published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and it outlines all mental disorders that are recognized by psychiatry. The fifth edition was published in May 2013 and it included a number of changes from the fourth edition.

One of the changes that was made in DSM-5 was the inclusion of gambling disorder as a mental disorder. Gamblers can now receive a diagnosis of gambling disorder if they meet certain criteria, such as experiencing problems with control, being preoccupied with gambling, or continuing to gamble despite negative consequences.

So far, there has been a mixed reaction to the inclusion of gambling disorder in DSM-5. Some people feel that it will help to reduce the stigma attached to gambling addiction, while others feel that it will lead to more people being incorrectly diagnosed with a mental disorder.

It is too early to say what effect the inclusion of gambling disorder in DSM-5 will have on rates of addiction. However, one thing is for sure â€“ if gambling were added to DSM-5, blackjack would be the most popular game!

#  Gambling addition to DSM-5 supports blackjack as a valid mental health condition!

The addition of gambling addiction to the DSM-5 has been a topic of much debate in the mental health community. Some professionals feel that gambling addiction is a valid mental health condition, while others claim that it is nothing more than a ploy by casinos to get people to bet more money.

Now that DSM-5 has been released, we can finally put this debate to rest. The latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders includes gambling addiction as a valid mental health condition. This means that blackjack can now be considered a legitimate form of therapy for people with gambling addiction.

While some opponents of DSM-5 will undoubtedly continue to argue against the inclusion of gambling addiction, the overwhelming majority of mental health professionals agree that it is a legitimate condition. Gambling addiction has been listed in the DSM for many years, and there is ample evidence to support its inclusion as a valid mental health disorder.

If you or someone you know suffers from gambling addiction, don't hesitate to seek help. There are many treatment options available, and blackjack can be an effective form of therapy for people with this condition.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) has been open for public comment since it was released in May 2013. The DSM-5 is a guide used by mental health professionals to diagnose mental disorders. It's also used by insurance companies to determine coverage for treatment.

There's been a lot of discussion about the proposed changes to the DSM-5, including the addition of gambling disorder as a recognized mental health disorder.

Gambling disorder is defined as "a persistent and recurrent gambling behavior that causes significant distress or impairment." The disorder is characterized by three main symptoms:

1. Gambling more than intended or for longer than intended.
2. Feeling restless or irritable when attempting to stop gambling.
3. Returning to gambling after losing money in an attempt to win back what was lost.
