#  Hollywood Casino's Roulette Wheel Appears to be Rigged

It has been reported that some gamblers at Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, believe that the roulette wheel may be rigged.
This comes after a number of people have reportedly won large sums of money on specific numbers, only to see those numbers not come up again for a long time afterwards.

One gambler, who asked to remain anonymous, said "I was playing blackjack and switched to roulette. I put $20 on 27 and it came up. I couldn't believe it. So I went back in and put another $20 on 27 and it didn't come up for about 15 spins."
He then went on to say "I know it's just a coincidence but it's been driving me crazy. I'm going to stay away from that number from now on."

Another gambler, who also wished to remain anonymous, said "I had been playing poker all night and decided to switch to roulette. I put $10 on red and after a few spins, it came up. I thought wow, this is awesome. So I put another $10 on red and it didn't come up for about 20 spins."
She went on to say "I don't know if the wheel is rigged or not, but it's definitely made me think twice about playing roulette here again."

In response to these allegations, the casino has issued a statement saying "The gaming commission has inspected our equipment and found no irregularities. We always encourage our guests to report any concerns they may have so that we can investigate them."

#  Players Claim that Hollywood Casino's Roulette Wheel is Biased

Players at the Hollywood Casino in Toledo, Ohio are claiming that the roulette wheel is biased against them. They say that the ball always seems to end up on the red numbers, regardless of how well they bet.

The casino has denied any claims of bias and says that the wheel is perfectly fair. However, some players are convinced that something is wrong and are considering taking legal action.

This isn't the first time that a casino's roulette wheel has been accused of being rigged. In fact, there have been numerous cases of this happening around the world. It's a difficult thing to prove, though, and most casinos will deny any allegations.

If you're concerned that the roulette wheel at your casino might be biased, there are a few things you can do to protect yourself:

- Always play using honest wheels: There are a number of websites that list which casinos have honest wheels, so make sure to choose one of those establishments.

- Use a betting system: A betting system can help you to make more accurate predictions about where the ball will land. This will give you a better chance of winning money.

- Don't bet too much: If you're betting large sums of money, you're more likely to be upset if you lose. It's important to keep your betting amounts manageable so that you don't end up losing too much money if things don't go your way.

#  $100,000 Winner Claims that Hollywood Casino Roulette is Fixed

A $100,000 winner from the Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana has come forward with allegations that the casino’s roulette wheels are rigged.

The winner, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that she has been playing at the casino for years and has always managed to walk away with a profit – until now. In a statement made to local media, the woman said that on her most recent visit she lost nearly $5,000 over the course of a few hours playing roulette at the casino.

When she asked casino personnel about the discrepancy, she was told that it was simply due to bad luck and that the house always wins in the end. The woman didn’t buy this explanation and decided to do some research on her own. What she found was that not only were other players reporting similar losses at Hollywood Casino, but that the odds of roulette favouring the house are actually quite low.

In light of this evidence, the woman is convinced that the casino is using a biased wheel in order to ensure its own profits. She is now considering legal action against Hollywood Casino as a result.

#  Bettors Say that Hollywood Casino Uses a crooked roulette wheel

There is a widespread belief among seasoned casino patrons that the roulette wheel at Hollywood Casino is crooked. Dozens of people interviewed by The Signal allege that the wheel has a bias that awards wins to the house more often than it should.

"I know for a fact that the wheel is rigged," said one regular player at the casino, who wished to remain anonymous. "I've seen it time and time again. The house always seems to win."

Bettors say they have observed several instances in which the ball narrowly missed hitting black numbers but landed on red instead, resulting in a loss for them. They also claim that the ball tends to bounce erratically around the wheel, increasing the likelihood of it landing on a specific number.

Hollywood Casino denies any wrongdoing. In a statement, a spokesperson said: "The integrity of our games is of utmost importance to us. We employ several measures to ensure fairness and accuracy, including routine audits by an independent third party."

However, some bettors are not convinced. "I don't trust them one bit," said another player. "They're just trying to cover up their tracks."

#  Roulette Wheel at Hollywood Casino Looks Rigged, Players Complain

A roulette wheel at Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, is being called rigged by some players after they have allegedly witnessed the ball landing on the same number multiple times in a row.

According to local news station WLWT5, one player, who did not want to be identified, said they saw the ball land on number eight several times in a row.

The player said they notified casino staff about the apparent issue but their complaint was allegedly dismissed.

"They just told me it's just luck," the player told WLWT5. "I'm like, 'How can it be luck when it happened multiple times?'."

The complaints about the alleged rigged wheel come as no surprise to some industry experts who say that casinos are always looking for an edge over players.

"Casinos are in the business of making money," Seattle-based gaming consultant Rickinstated via email. "They will do whatever they can to make sure they win."

Roulette wheels at casinos are typically not actually rigged, but there is some concern that this could be a sign of things to come as more and more states legalize gambling.
