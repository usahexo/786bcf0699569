#  What is the Legacy of Doom? 

Since 1993, the "Legacy of Doom" has been cited as one of the most important factors in the successful run of the University of Connecticut men's basketball program. The term was coined by Hartford Courant sportswriter Jeff Jacobs, and refers to the Huskies' 0-3 record against Duke in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. 

The first meeting between the two teams came in the 1991 Final Four, when Duke won 71-58. Connecticut then lost to Duke in both the 1992 and 1994 championship games, by scores of 77-74 and 78-74, respectively. 

Connecticut finally ended their streak by defeating Duke 79-78 on April 4th, 1999, in the semifinal round of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. This upset victory is often credited with launching Connecticut's "new dynasty", as they would go on to win not only that year's championship game, but also NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships in 2004 and 2011. 

While it is impossible to know for certain what role, if any, "The Legacy of Doom" played in Connecticut's eventual success, it is clear that this phrase has become a part of popular culture. In fact, it was even mentioned on an episode of NBC's popular sitcom The Office.

#  Who Created the Legacy of Doom?

The legacy of Doom is a long and complicated one. The first game in the series was created by Id Software in 1993, and it single-handedly defined the first-person shooter genre. But who is responsible for the legacy of Doom?

Id Software is the obvious answer, but there are other contributors as well. For example, publishers GT Interactive Software played a major role in marketing and promoting the game. And without Carmack’s programming genius, it’s likely that Doom would have been a much lesser game.

But Id Software is the key player here. John Carmack, John Romero, and Adrian Carmack (no relation to John) formed Id Software in 1991, and they were responsible for all three major releases in the early 1990s: Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM, and Quake.

 id Software was also responsible for popularizing multiplayer gaming with DOOM, which allowed players to connect to gaming servers via the internet. This laid the groundwork for modern multiplayer games like Halo and Call of Duty.

So while other developers and publishers played a role in Doom’s success, Id Software is ultimately responsible for creating one of the most influential video games of all time.
